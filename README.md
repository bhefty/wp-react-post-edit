Additional features:
  - *The best test setup:* Guarantee code quality and non-breaking changes.
  - *Native web app:* Add the web app to the user's phone home screen!
  - *Fast fonts:* Quick loading for text!
  - *Stay fast:* Profile app's performance from the command line.
  - *Catch problems:* CircleCI ensures builds are passing!

## Quick start

1. Clone repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/bhefty/react-redux-boilerplate.git [your app name]`
2. Move into the directory: `cd [your app name]`
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the app at `http://localhost:3000`

> Please note that this boilerplate was built by going through every file, line by line, of <a href='https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate'>react-boilerplate</a>
and adapting it to suit my needs. The concepts of this boilerplate are advanced and not easily approached by beginners.


## Deployment

### Heroku

1. Run `heroku create [your app name]` to initialize the Heroku app.
2. *Optional:* A `Procfile` with the following line: `web: npm run start:prod` has already been created. Change this if needed.
3. Install the Node.js buildpack for the Heroku app by running `heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs#v106 -a [your app name]`.
Make sure to replace `#106` with the latest buildpack, found <a href='https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/releases'>here</a>.
4. *Optional:* A `"heroku-postbuild": "npm run build"` and `"prebuild": "npm run build:clean"` scripts have already been added to `package.json`. This will avoide having Heroku attempt
to run Jest tests (which are unsupported with this buildpack). Change this if needed.
5. Run `heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false` so that Heroku can comile the npm modules included in `devDependencies` (since some are required for build process).
6. Follow the standard Heroku deploy process:
  1. `git add .`
  2. `git commit -m 'Made some epic changes as per usual`
  3. `git push heroku master`

As mentioned before, this project was heavily influenced by the geniuses behind <a href='https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate'>react-boilerplate</a>.
As such, much of my code is the same, with slight alterations to suit my needs. Additional documentation and help may be available <a href='https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/tree/master/docs'>here</a>.
